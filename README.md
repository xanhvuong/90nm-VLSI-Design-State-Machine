State Machine Project Overview

The State Machine project focuses on studying, designing, and simulating the operation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) in digital system and IC design. FSMs are fundamental models widely applied in logic control, microprocessors, and embedded systems.

This repository not only includes FSM-related files and examples, but also essential references and toolkits used throughout the project:

CSHELL COOKBOOK.pdf: A guide to using C-Shell for scripting and automation.

Full Custom IC Design Using Synopsys Galaxy.pdf: Documentation on full custom IC design using the Synopsys Galaxy tool suite.

ICC II_PHYSICAL SYNTHESIS.pdf: Material on physical synthesis in IC design.

SAED90nm_Design_Rules.pdf and SAED90nm_Interoperable_Process_Design_Kit.pdf: Design rules and PDK for SAED 90nm technology.

State.txt and State_Test.txt: Files describing and testing the FSM states.

lab.zip: Contains source files and lab exercises for the project.

Objectives

Understand the working principles of a Finite State Machine.

Design and simulate an FSM for a specific application.

Gain practical skills in using EDA tools (Synopsys, SAED PDK).

Apply IC design rules and practice with 90nm technology.

Outcomes

Successfully described and verified the FSM with test cases.

Integrated the FSM into an IC design flow using Synopsys tools.

Compiled project documentation and references for further study and research
